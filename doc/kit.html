		<h3>-kit Frequency</h3>
		<p>We can look at the amount of times the suffix -kit appears to compare which arc has more kitten in it. Taking a look, it is pretty clear that The Broken Code has more kittens than The Prophecies begin. However, this gets interesting when we look at the -paw suffix.</p>
