  <h3><a href="free.html">Character Frequency</a></h3>
	<p>After looking at the frequency of prefixes between The Prophecies Begin and The Broken code, it can be determined which characters appeared in both arc. This data can then be put into a graph showing how frequently the character was in a scene or referenced. This helps visualize how frequently a character is mentioned or center stage. Sure numbers are great, but actually being able to see this data helps grasp how important the character is or isn't.</p>
	<p>For example we can look at the character Brindlewing. She only seems to appear at the very begining of books, all in the same or similar location. This shows that she was not a major character in the stories. Rather the was just listed in the character masterlist located at the front of every book. However, we take a look at Bramblestar, and we see that his name (or one of his names) appears in almost every book at some point. This not only tells us that he is important to the story, but that his also one of the oldest cats in the clans.</p>
