		<h3>-star Frequency</h3>
		<p>The star frequency is quite interesting. It can tell us how many times a power exchange has happened. There should only be 5 leaders at a time, if there are more than 5, we can assume that one leader has died, and another has taken their place. This also shows that leaders take up quite a bit of page space in both arcs.</p>
